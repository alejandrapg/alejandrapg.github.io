	<div><p>Robyn Rihanna Fenty (born February 20, 1988) is a Barbadian singer, songwriter, and actress. Born in Saint Michael and raised in Bridgetown, she first entered the music industry by recording demo tapes under the direction of record producer Evan Rogers in 2003. She ultimately signed a recording contract with Def Jam Recordings after auditioning for its then-president, hip hop producer and rapper Jay Z. In 2005, Rihanna rose to fame with the release of her debut studio album Music of the Sun and its follow-up A Girl like Me (2006), which charted on the top 10 of the US Billboard 200 and respectively produced the singles "Pon de Replay" and "SOS".</p></div>

<section id="why" class="RIRI2">
  <div> <p> I really love Rihanna because in a world of carefully packaged music stars, she stands out from the others. It means we can overlook less than incredible vocals and focus on what she’s amazing at: being fabulous. It helps that Rihanna is stunning; she’s always flawlees and has a lot of syle. She is very talented and is always very nice with her fans. She is an inspiration for me due to she managed to find success even though her childhood was plagued by her dad's cocaine and alcohol addiction. </p>
